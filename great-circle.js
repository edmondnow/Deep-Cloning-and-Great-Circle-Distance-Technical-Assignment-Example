We'd like to contact partners with offices within 100km of central London (coordinates 51.515419, -0.141099) to invite them out for a meal.

Write a NodeJS/JavaScript program that reads our list of partners (download partners.json here: https://success.spidergap.com/partners.json) and outputs the company names and addresses of matching partners (with offices within 100km) sorted by company name (ascending).

You can use the first formula from this Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) to calculate distance. Don't forget to convert degrees to radians! Your program should be fully tested too.
